# cdd

cdd is a set of scripts written in python and bash that make it
easier to navigate file system directories. It allows the user to
jump directly to frequently used directories, typing just a
few characters contained in the directory basename.

## installation

**Step 1: install `cdd`**. Use `pip install --user cdd`. I didn't
test whether it works installed as root user. Alternatively, you
can download the files directly from GitHub.

**Step 2: set up paths**. Once the scripts are installed, make
sure your `PATH` and your `PYTHONPATH` include `cdd` directories.
Usually, `pip --user` installs scripts in `~/.local/bin` and
libraries under `~/.local/lib/python2.7`. If this is your case,
add the first directory to your `PATH` and the second to your
`PYTHONPATH`.

**Step 3: set up the `cd` function**. This is achieved by sourcing
the `cdd-bash-function.sh` file. You can test `cdd` without
making it permanent, by sourcing the file containing the `cd`
function issuing the command `source
~/.local/bin/cdd-bash-function.sh`. To make it permanent, source
the file from within your `~/.profile`.

## use

Simply use `cd` as you are used to. Whenever you use `cd` to
navigate in the usual way within the file system, `cdd` will
store the directories seen. Once the directory is in the cdd
database, you can navigate directly to that directory, by typing

> `cd <pattern>`

where `<pattern>` is any part of the name of the subdirectory.
